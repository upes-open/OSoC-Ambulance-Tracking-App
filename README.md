### About the Project

The ambulance tracking app is a one-stop solution in case of a medical emergency. In such cases we usually call the hospital to provide for an ambulance but through this app we will be able to have a list of all the nearby hospitals along with their average cost of expenditure and can choose which ambulance to book. We will be able to locate the nearest available ambulance in real-time and request emergency medical assistance with a simple tap. Through this app we can provide accurate and up-to-date information about the emergency to the ambulance service and can receive notifications and updates regarding the estimated time of arrival.
